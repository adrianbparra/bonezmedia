                provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media
                provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and

                social media platform.</p>
                <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this
                privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services.
                Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your
                personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that
                you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your
                personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites

                electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be
                guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,

                <p>In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or delete

                <p>Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumerâ€™s Privacy Rights</p>

                <p>Verification process</p>
                <p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are
                the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These
                verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it
                with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the
                type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we
                can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file,
                or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that
                you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as
                the circumstances dictate.</p>
                <p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity
                or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting
                additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot
                verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and
                for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided
                information as soon as we finish verifying you.</p>

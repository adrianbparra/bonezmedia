<h2>Steps:</h2>
<h3>Step One</h3>
	<p>The first step is removing your old stereo that is accomplished by disconnecting your battery. Now every vehicle is different but have only two ways of mounting your stereo:
	<ul>
		<li>Spring Clips: DIN Tools needed</li>
		<li>Bolted: Sockets needed</li>
	</ul>
<h3>Step Two</h3>
<p>If spring clips are used the DIN tool will be needed to pull stereo out of stock location from left and right side of stereo. If it is bolted you will need to remove the piece of your car's dash to locate the stereo bolts. After removing your stereo disconnect it from the factory harness. 
<h3>Step Three</h3>
<p>Now the more time consuming part is connecting the new wire harness to the new stereo cables. All new stereos come with a diagram of what wire does what as well the new wire harness. This is when you match the cables and connect them using the crimp caps and crimp tool. If the integration module was purchased this is the time to connect it as well.
<h3>Step Four</h3>
<p>After you obtain the mounting kit and place it on the new stereo with the correct bolts that were provided or clip it if it you used clips.
<h3>Step Five</h3>
<p>Now all you need is to connect all the new wires such as the wiring harness and antenna adapter to the factory harness and factory antenna cable. Before bolting the stereo to the factory location it is best to test your connection by connecting the battery back and powering your new stereo.
<h3>Step Six</h3>
<p>Once all functions are working correctly you may now clip your stereo to the stock locations or bolt it down if it came with bolts.
